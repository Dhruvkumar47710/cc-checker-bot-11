To install and set up a Telegram bot, you'll need to follow a few steps. Here's a guide to help you:

1. **Create a Telegram Bot:**
   - Open the Telegram app and search for the "BotFather."
   - Start a chat with BotFather and use the `/newbot` command to create a new bot.
   - Follow the prompts to name your bot and choose a username. BotFather will give you a token; save this token as you’ll need it for coding.

2. **Set Up Your Development Environment:**
   - Choose a programming language you're comfortable with. Popular choices include Python, Node.js, and PHP.
   - Install any necessary libraries or frameworks for your chosen language. For example, if you're using Python, you might want to use `python-telegram-bot` or `telepot`.

3. **Write the Bot Code:**
   - Here’s a basic example using Python with `python-telegram-bot`:

     ```python
     from telegram import Update
     from telegram.ext import Updater, CommandHandler, CallbackContext

     # Define a function for the /start command
     def start(update: Update, context: CallbackContext) -> None:
         update.message.reply_text('Hello! I am your bot.')

     def main() -> None:
         # Replace 'YOUR_TOKEN_HERE' with your actual bot token
         updater = Updater("YOUR_TOKEN_HERE")

         dp = updater.dispatcher

         # Register the /start command handler
         dp.add_handler(CommandHandler("start", start))

         # Start the Bot
         updater.start_polling()

         # Run the bot until you send a signal to stop (Ctrl+C)
         updater.idle()

     if __name__ == '__main__':
         main()
     ```

   - Save this script as `bot.py` and run it using Python.

4. **Deploy Your Bot:**
   - You can run your bot locally for testing. For continuous operation, consider deploying it on a server or cloud service like Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud.

5. **Test Your Bot:**
   - Open Telegram, find your bot using the username you set, and send the `/start` command to test if it responds as expected.

By following these steps, you'll have a basic Telegram bot up and running. You can expand its functionality by adding more handlers and features according to your needs.
